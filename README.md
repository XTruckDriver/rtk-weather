## Weather Project

This project has been created by Mark Smyth, a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

This application allows the user to enter a city and it returns a 5 day forecast in the form of sparkline charts. The user can add multiple cities which will create a list of weather forecasts. Individual city forecasts can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button.

If you have any questions about this project or the program in general, visit [parsity.io](https://parsity.io/) or email hello@parsity.io.
